# Managing Auto-Updates
By default, OpenMod automatically updates itself on each server start. You can change this behavior by doing any of these:

- Start server with `-NoOpenModAutoUpdate` argument.
- Set `OpenMod__EnableAutoUpdate` environment variable to `false`.

OpenMod will always download its core components on the first start.
